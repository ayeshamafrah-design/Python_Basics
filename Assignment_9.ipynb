    "The three \"mode\" arguments that can be passed to the `open()` function in Python are:\n",

    "If an existing file is opened in write mode (`'w'`) in Python, the file will be truncated, which means all existing data in the file will be erased.

    "A shelf value in Python resembles a dictionary. It is a persistent, dictionary-like object that is stored as a file on the disk. It supports all the dictionary operations such as accessing items by key, adding new items, and deleting items. However, unlike a dictionary, a shelf value stores its data in a file, allowing it to persist between Python sessions.\n"
