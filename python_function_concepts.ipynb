    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **`map()` Function**: The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns a map object (which is an iterator). It is functionally similar to list comprehension but is often considered less readable for simple cases. It can be more efficient when working with complex functions or external function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Comparison**:\n",
    "  - **List comprehensions** are often preferred for their readability and simplicity, especially for short, clear operations.\n",
    "  - **`map()`** can be used when you want to apply a function to the entire iterable, and it is more efficient when using pre-defined functions.\n",
    "  - Both **return a sequence** of values, but **list comprehension** creates a list directly, while `map()` returns a map object, which is an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Summary**:\n",
    "  - Use list comprehensions for simplicity and readability.\n",
    "  - Use `map()` when you have a pre-existing function and want to apply it to an iterable in a functional style."
