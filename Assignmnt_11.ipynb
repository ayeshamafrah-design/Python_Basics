    "Using logging messages is better than using `print()` for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Granular Control**: Logging allows you to set different levels of messages (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`), which allows you to control the amount of detail you see in your logs. This is especially useful in debugging and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Destination**: Logging messages can be directed to different destinations such as a file, console, or even a remote server, making it more versatile than `print()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formatting**: Logging allows you to format your log messages in a structured way, making them easier to read and parse by automated tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance**: Logging is generally more efficient than `print()` for large volumes of output, as it is designed to handle logging in a more optimized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Severity Levels**: Logging allows you to differentiate between different severity levels of messages, which can help you prioritize and address issues more effectively.\n"

    "What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step Over**: When you click the Step Over button, the debugger will execute the current line of code and then move to the next line in the current function. If the current line contains a function call, the debugger will not enter the function but will instead move to the next line after the function call in the current function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step In**: Clicking the Step In button will cause the debugger to move into the function call on the current line. If the current line does not contain a function call, Step In will behave the same as Step Over.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step Out**: Step Out is used when you are currently inside a function and want to execute the rest of the function without stepping through it line by line. Clicking Step Out will cause the debugger to execute the remaining lines of the current function and then stop at the line immediately after the function call that led to the current function.\n"

    "What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A breakpoint is a marker set in source code that tells the debugger to temporarily pause program execution at that point. When the debugger encounters a breakpoint during execution, it stops the program and allows you to inspect the state of the program, such as the values of variables, the call stack, and the current line of execution. Breakpoints are useful for debugging because they allow you to control the flow of your program and examine its behavior at specific points.\n"
