    "What is the difference between string and variable? \n",

    "A **string** is a data type used to represent textual data. It is a sequence of characters enclosed within single (' ') or double (\" \") quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "For example: 'hello' or \"ineuron\" are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **variable** on the other hand, is a symbolic name or identifier that can be used to store and manipulate data. Variables can hold various types of data, including strings. When you assign a string to a variable, you are associating that variable with the string value.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "variable_example = 42\n",
    "print(variable_example)\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Integer (int):** An integer is a whole number without any decimal point. It can be positive or negative, such as 5, -10, or 0.\n",
    "\n",

    "What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "An **expression** in programming is made up of a combination of values, variables, and operators. It can include literals, variables, and/or operations that, when evaluated, produce a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components of an Expression:**\n",
    "- **Values:** Constants or variables representing data (example: numbers, strings).\n",
    "- **Operators:** Symbols that perform operations on values or variables (example: +, -, *, /).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of Expressions:**\n",
    "Expressions serve the purpose of computing and producing a result. When an expression is evaluated, the values and operators are processed according to the rules of the programming language, and a final value is returned. Expressions are fundamental for performing calculations, making decisions, and manipulating data within a program.\n"

    "This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, an **expression** is a combination of values, variables, and operators that, when evaluated, produces a single value. example: `spam = 10` contains the expression `10`, and when this expression is executed, it assigns the value `10` to the variable `spam`.\n",

    "A **statement**, on the other hand, is a complete line of code that performs an action. The assignment statement `spam = 10` is an example of a statement. It not only contains an expression (`10`) but also carries out the action of assigning that value to the variable `spam`.\n",
